When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- Using a remote repository is a great way to share work you've done. Plus you'll quite easilly be able to pick up
working on it from any computer with an internet connection!  And you can collaborate with anyone with an internet
connection as well. Plus if beer gets spilled all over your computer at least all the stuff you've pushed will 
still be around.
